# RustCAM

Welcome! This is the RustCAM library and app. This app and library are intended to be a set of tools for programmatically generating G-CODE for CNC machines using algorithms written in Rust. Niche, I know... Enjoy!

So far the tooling only runs my contour plotting code (ported from Ruby, original [here](https://github.com/careyi3/contour_plots)). In future there will be an abstraction layer to make the G-CODE generation separate and I plan to plug in different generation code.
